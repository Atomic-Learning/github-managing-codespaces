<p>The page [github.com/codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces) displays a list of your Codespaces, as in the image below. </p>

<p>This view shows the name of each Codespace, which repository it is associated with, what type of machine it is running on, how much data is stored in it, and its current state. By opening the menu of a particular Codespace, you can perform various actions including deleting it, or stopping it if it is active.</p>

<h2>Limits to Simultaneous Active Codespaces</h2>

<p>GitHub only allows a user to have a limited number of active Codespaces at a time. Trying to open more Codespaces than the limit will result in an error, like the one below.</p>

<img src="/resources/too_many_running_codespaces_error.png" alt="Codespaces limit error message" width="600px">

<p>This error will be displayed on the page <a href="https://github.com/codespaces" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">github.com/codespaces</a>. This allows you to manage your active Codespaces by stopping or deleting some of them to free up space for new ones.</p>
